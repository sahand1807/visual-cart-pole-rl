PPO is known for its stability and strong performance. Its core job is to analyze the agent's experiences (the images, actions, and rewards) and update the neural network to produce better actions over time. It intelligently balances **exploration** (trying new things to find better strategies) and **exploitation** (using the best-known strategies).\n","\n","* **The Policy (`CnnPolicy`):** This is a pre-built policy structure from Stable Baselines3 that is specifically designed for tasks with image-based observations. It provides the general architecture, which includes a feature extractor (the CNN part) and \"heads\" that decide on the next action and estimate the value of the current state.\n","\n","* **The Custom Feature Extractor (`CustomCNN`):** This is our key customization. We are telling the `CnnPolicy` to *not* use its default CNN. Instead, we instruct it to use our `CustomCNN` class as its feature extractor. We pass this instruction using the `policy_kwargs` dictionary, which allows us to configure the policy's internal components.\n","\n","* **The Training Process (`model.learn()`):** When we call this function, the main training loop begins. The agent will repeatedly perform actions in our four parallel environments, collect batches of experience, and use the PPO algorithm to update its network weights.
